# Why?
Because I can, lol.

# How functional is it?

# BEFORE BEGINNING :

I would recommend NOT using SkypeReviver unless you can't wait for 
SkypeReviver v.1.2 which should be released soon , potentially allowing you to keep the conversations
you had before locally , if you had used Skype before its shutdown. I'm saying this just in case you really need your
old conversations on Skype AND MS teams rather than just in Teams' servers. ;)

# Instructions

To use SkypeReviver, you need to have :

• Downloaded Skype version 8.138

• Then run SkypeReviver and click both "Disable Skype Updater" and "Open Skype Installation Folder"

# BEWARE : 

Continuing to the next step WILL DELETE locally stored conversations,
not from skype-teams' servers , just from your device.

• In the two File Explorer windows that appeared , delete from both of them a folder named "Skype from desktop".
It is of UTMOST importance that you do this, since when a Skype installation contacts a specific MS server , it forever becomes bricked,
even after patching through SkypeReviver, requiring you to completely remove it, including the 2 directories it made, which you can access (and delete) at any time by 
clicking the "Open Skype Installation Folder" button.

• Install Skype version 8.138.

• After installation, Skype should automatically open.

Done! You should still be logged into your account if you had already connected woth your account before Skype's shutdown.
If you hadn't ever logged in from this device , you *should* be able to login normally by following Skype's instructions.
