# Why?
Because I can, lol.

# How does it work?
I am planning to post a video to Youtube (Around 15-20th June most likely) , explaining the whole story of what I attempted and what actually ended up working.

# How functional is it?

- [X]  Video Calling
- [X]  Calling
- [?]  Dial Pad (Untested, if it works for you let me know through reddit, see bottom of page)
- ðŸš§   Presence (Active,Away,DND etc) (Works only when calling)
- [ ]  Messaging

# Prerequisites :

To use SkypeReviver, you need :

â€¢ A Skype version 8.138 installer

â€¢ Latest version of SkypeReviver available.

# BEWARE : 

As of writing , 30th May 2025, to use SkypeReviver you WILL have to DELETE locally stored conversations,
not from skype-teams' servers , just and only from your device. So basically your convos will still be available in Teams servers, but not stored locally on your computer on Skype (look at BEFORE BEGINNING).
I am planning to release v1.2 soon, which will allow you to keep your convos.

# Instructions :

â€¢ In the two File Explorer windows that appeared , delete from both of them a folder named "Skype from desktop".
It is of UTMOST importance that you do this, since when a Skype installation contacts a specific MS server , it forever becomes bricked,
even after patching through SkypeReviver, requiring you to completely remove it, including the 2 directories it made, which you can access (and delete) at any time by 
clicking the "Open Skype Installation Folder" button.

â€¢ Install Skype version 8.138.

â€¢ After installation, Skype should automatically open.

Done! You should still be logged into your account if you had already connected with your account before Skype's shutdown.
If you hadn't ever logged in from this device , you *should* be able to login normally by following Skype's instructions,as it always was.
